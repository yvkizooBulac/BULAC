        My name is Virgilio A. Bulac Jr., a boy with many ambitions, dreams, and goals.
        I was born on December 3, 2006. I have four brothers.
        An interesting fact about me is that whenever I keep losing, I always keep my
        head up and use it as motivation to do even better.
        Another fun fact about me is that I always prioritize others more than myself
        because I want people to smile and be happy.
        My favorite color is black, and my favorite food is kinilaw and lechon.

    <p style="color:aqua; text-align:Arial;">
        I find happiness when I play video games and laugh with my friends.
        Most of my time is spent playing Mobile Legends or any other games
        that pique my interest.
        I once dreamed of becoming a professional Mobile Legends player,
        but now it remains just a dream.
        I also find joy when I spend time with my beloved girlfriend.
        She motivates me when I'm down and is my best friend and most beloved person.

        I am 19 years old, a first-year college student majoring in BS Computer Science.
        I am a slow learner, but I always strive to learn new things.
        I currently reside in Bool District, Tagbilaran City, living with my mom and brothers.
        My dad sadly passed away on February 22, 2022.
        My promise to him is to graduate, find a stable job, and provide for my mom.
